# Sundered Core

**Reality Frays. Power is Unbound.**

**Sundered is not a variant or clone.**  
Itâ€™s a complete tabletop system built around agency and tactics, where one unified pool drives every action, and player choice is embedded into every mechanic.

## ðŸŽ® What Makes It Different

- **One Pool. One System.**  
  Every action â€” from spells and attacks to counters and movement â€” draws from the same unified resource: Source. Thereâ€™s no separate economy for bonus actions, reactions, or spell slots.

- **Convert Anything. Trade Everything.**  
  Source, movement, and even hit points are interchangeable. Burn what you have to get what you need.

- **No Passive Turns.**  
  Every player can counter, block, or redirect â€” even when itâ€™s not their initiative.

- **Tactical Freedom with Real Cost.**  
  Push beyond your limits using Stress and Strain mechanics. Thereâ€™s no ceiling â€” only consequences.

This repo is for the official Sundered SRD, not homebrew content.

- **Built for Creators.**  
  Released under the [Sundered Creator License (SCL)](https://sunderedsystems.com/license) so you can publish, sell, and expand the system freely.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Sundered isnâ€™t about limits. Itâ€™s about possibility.

Most systems gate power behind class, level, or siloed mechanics. Sundered lets you act â€” boldly and often â€” and rewards creative decision-making with real impact. No waiting for your turn to matter. No arbitrary ceilings.

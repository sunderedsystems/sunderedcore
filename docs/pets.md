# Pets

A pet is a loyal animal or mount that fights, travels, and explores by your side.
Unlike familiars, pets are natural or magical creatures that rely on your guidance for most actions.
Pets are hardier than familiars but less versatile, cannot use your Source, and do not share in Echelon bonuses.
They serve as companions, protectors, and allies.

Pets follow Familiar rules with several key differences:

- Loyal animals or mounts
- Rely on your guidance
- **Do not gain Echelon bonuses**
- **Do not link Source**
- **Cannot use your Source**

---

## Pet Tiers

Pets follow the same rarity scale as Familiars, and have their own Source Pool according to their tier:

- Common  
- Uncommon  
- Rare  
- Heroic  
- Legendary  
- Mythic

---

## Pet Hit Points

> **Pet HP = Your Total HP/# of pets**

- More **durable** than Familiars
- Less **versatile**

---

## Pet Status & Discipline Checks

- Pets **cannot** make Discipline Checks
- They **can suffer** status effects (e.g., fear, poison, paralysis)

If a pet is targeted by a check or effect:
- Use the **owner's relevant ability score**
- Apply **modifiers + proficiency** if applicable

> Note: Pet size is limited by Proficiency (see Size Limits for Familiars, Pets, and Summons). If a pet exceeds Humanoid in size, attacks that require a "hit" to deal damage or apply an effect target the owner's Constitution instead of Agility.

---

## Pet Range

- Must be within **120ft** to issue direct commands
- On the same plane, pets follow **prior orders** if within natural ability
- Pets remain **active** unless destroyed by external circumstances

---

## Pet Attributes

Pets follow **item attribute rules** and may have **up to 9 attributes**

Each Pet has:

- **50ft movement per round**
- **Press the Attack**, **Dig In**, **Arcane Advantage**
- Attack rolls use **your proficiency**
- Pets may **use techniques/spells they know** with their Source

## Pet Rolls

Pets use the **character’s proficiency** for all combat rolls.

- **d20 + proficiency**  

> Example:  
> Your pet makes a melee, ranged, or spell attack = d20 + Your Proficiency

### Movement Conversion Table

| Action              | Pet Movement Cost           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Interact with object| 5ft                              |
| Melee/Ranged attack | 20ft                             |
| Spellcasting        | 10ft × spell level + 20ft        |

## Pet Actions & Control

- Pets follow your **intent**, acting semi-autonomously:
  - Attack known threats
  - Move to specified locations
  - Defend allies

### Core Action: Command

When you **Command** your Pet, attacks or spells use your spell modifier **and** proficiency.

Spend **1 Core Action** (or equivalent) to:

- Control your Pet, using its movement and SD

- Activate your Pet's attributes (techniques)

> Example: Activating your pet's attributes/techniequs costs 2 Core actions or Equivalent -- Core action: Command and a Core Action + Technique Level

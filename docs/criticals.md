# Criticals & Effects

## Natural Crit

A **Natural Crit** occurs when you roll a **natural 20** on a d20 melee, ranged, or spell attack.

### Damage Output

- **Do not roll**—instead, deal the **maximum possible damage** from your committed pool:  
  > Max value of all dice + modifier + proficieny (if proficient)

### Critical Effect

- You may apply **one** critical effect from the **Critical Table** without spending from your CDB (Critical Damage Bank).
- Roll a d20. Apply an effect within the tier rolled.
    i.e. 1-5 = a Minor. 5-10 = Moderate. 10-15 = Severe 15-20 = Catastrophic.

### Defense Interaction

- Damage can still be **reduced** via Block, Dodge, or Counter
- **Status effects** from Natural Crits **cannot be prevented** — even if all damage is blocked

> Exception: A **critical counterspell** can prevent **both** damage and the status effect

## Healing Criticals

Critical injuries must be healed by spells or abilities that **specifically remove conditions or injuries**.

# Momentum & Renown

## Momentum

Momentum is a **narrative resource pool** representing the shifting tide of advantage between players and the GM. It flows dynamically based on rolls and story events.

When one group controls more than half of the Momentum pool, that group **ignores stress penalties** on stressed checks.

---

### Starting the Momentum Pool

- Total tokens = **number of people at the table** (including the GM)
- All tokens start in the **neutral pool**, equally shared

---

### Earning Momentum

Players or GM gain momentum by:

- **Rolling a natural 20** (A critical success)
- **Succeeding on a stressed or strained check**
- **Tactical brilliance or narrative moments**, as judged by the GM

---

### Momentum Pool Balance

If one group holds **more than half the tokens**:

- They **ignore penalties** on stressed or strained checks  
  > (The check is still considered stressed/strained, but the **+1 DC** is ignored)

---

### Losing Momentum

A group **loses** a momentum token when:

- A **critical failure (natural 1)** occurs  
- A **stressed or strained check fails**
- The opposition has a critical success or passes a stress/strained check and there are **no neutral tokens to pull from**

If the group has tokens, return **one to the neutral pool**.  
If no tokens are held, **nothing happens** (tokens cannot be **pushed** to the opposition)

> Momentum is **never transferred directly** to the other side

---

### GM Discretion

- The GM **may award** momentum for strong roleplay, humor, or heroism
- The GM **cannot remove** tokens directly from players

# Summoned Creatures

A summoned creature is a being temporarily called into existence by your magic. Unlike pets or familiars, summoned creatures are conjured or animated, exist only while sustained by your power, and vanish when their Source is depleted or you choose to dismiss them.

Summoned creatures act as your magical extensions on the battlefield. They inherit your Echelon bonuses, operate with their own hit points and Source allocation, and follow your intent—either acting autonomously or under your direct command. They cannot replenish themselves, and their strength is limited by the SD you invest in them.

- Inherit your **Echelon bonuses**
- Do not require item binding
- Have independent HP and Source allocation
- Act with autonomy

---

## Summoning Mechanics

- Uses **spellcasting rules**
- Must **learn** each summoning spell rank separately
- Spend **SD equal to the creature’s rank** (based on item tiers)
- May exceed proficiency cap in expenditure to summon 

### Summoning Difficulty

**Single creature**:
> DC = 30 + rank – (Spellcasting Score + Proficiency if proficient)

**Multiple creatures**:
> DC = 30 + highest rank + number of creatures – (Spellcasting + Proficiency if proficient)

---

## Source Commitment

- **Max active summons = your total SD**
- Allocate SD to each summoned creature during summoning. Each summons must retain 1 SD to remain active.
- While any summons are active:
  - You **do not suffer empty pool penalties**

### Example

You have 12 SD and summon two creatures:
- 10 SD to one, 2 SD to the other  
- You can’t spend any more SD unless one is dismissed

---

## Source Return

- SD committed to a summon is **locked** as long as it has 1 SD or more
- If the summon drops to 0 HP or is dismissed:
  - **Half of its remaining SD** is returned (min 0)

---

## Replenishment & Redistribution

- **Only the summoner** regains SD via Replenishment
- Replenishment **cannot** exceed your Source Pool
- While your summons are Active, your Source Pool is not considered empty
- You may **manually transfer or redistribute SD** to your summons on your turn by using a Core Action or Equivalent

> Example: You regain 6 SD → You choose how much to allocate to summons

---

## Redistributing SD

- Add/remove SD from a summon by spending a **Core Action or equivalent** on your turn
- HP adjusts immediately based on new SD total

---

## Hit Points

> **HP = SD committed × Summoning Die Size**

- **Summoning Die Size** is based on your **caster level**: d6, d8, or d10

> Example:  
4 SD with a d8 summoning die = **32 HP**

---

## Summon Attributes

Each summon has:

- **50ft movement per round**
- **Press the Attack**, **Dig In**, **Arcane Advantage**
- Attack rolls use **your proficiency** (unless commanded)
- Summons may cast cantrips **you know** in place of melee/ranged attacks.

## Summon Rolls

Summons use the **character’s proficiency** for all combat rolls (unless commanded)

- **d20 + proficiency**  

> Example:  
> Your summon makes a melee, ranged, or spell attack = d20 + Your Proficiency (unless Commanded)

## Summon vs Familiar

| Feature              | Summon               | Familiar              |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| HP                   | Independent           | None (damage transfers to you) |
| Bound to Item        | No                    | Yes                   |
| Source Use           | From you              | From you or their item |
| Discipline Checks    | No                    | Yes (via your stats)  |
| Regeneration         | Cannot self-regen     | Item-based            |

---

## Summoning Limits

- Cannot exceed **your total SD** in active summons (# limited by your total SD)
- Summons cannot:
  - Summon other creatures
  - Use **conversion**
  - Scale damage with SD unless "Commanded"
- You may dismiss individually or all at once (Core Action / equivalent)

> Dismissed summons return **half of current SD** (min 0)

> **You + summons** share the **same proficiency cap** for SD spent per round

---

## Status & Discipline Checks

- Cannot make **Discipline Checks**
- Can suffer **status effects** (fear, poison, paralysis)

If targeted or affected:
- Use **your** spellcasting score and spellcasting proficiency

---

## Scaling and Damage

Unless commanded:

- Use your **proficiency** for all rolls (roll a d20 + your proficiency)
- **Base damage = your proficiency**
- Damage may be scaled with:
  - Unspent Movement (Press the Attack)

---

## Summoned Actions & Control

- Summons follow your **intent**, acting semi-autonomously:
  - Attack known threats
  - Move to specified locations
  - Defend allies

### Core Action: Command

Under **Command**, checks are made with your spellcasting abiity + proficiency if proficient.

Spend **1 Core Action** (or equivalent) to:

- Command a **group** (shared 50ft pool of movement and **collective** SD for 1 Action) 
- Actions taken apply to all summons in the group, and SD spent are divided as you choose among the group.
- Scale damage/effects with SD
> Note: if an action expending Source Dice would use a summons last SD, that summons or group of summons expire.

- Control a **single summon** using its full pool and SD

- While under command, Summons' damage = to **your base spell damage**

> Example: Activating a spell through your summons costs 2 Core actions or Equivalent -- Core action: Command and a Core Action + Spell Level

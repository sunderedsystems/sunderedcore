# Items and Magic

## Magical Items

Magical items store power—each has its own limit. They can then fuel **abilities**, **techniques**, and **spells**, acting as an expanded Source Pool.

---

## Attunement

To store source in an item, a character must **attune** to it.

### Attunement Time

- Takes **1 day per SD Capacity** of the item
- For each day of attunement: access **+1 SD capacity**

### Attunement Limit

- A character may be attuned to magical items with a **combined SD capacity no greater than their base character Source**
- This is **before** item bonuses or temporary boosts

---

## Capacity (Items)

- Your maximum source limit is increased by how much an item can hold
- When you Replenish, you may now gain Source Dice up to your combined personal reservoir + item capacity

---

## Using Item Source

- Item SD can fuel any ability, spell, or technique
- Item SD is tracked as part of your pool.
- Makes magical items valuable for:
  - **Emergency surges**
  - **Prolonged encounters**
  - **Bypassing SD limits**

---

## Crafting Magical Items

Crafting = investing Source, time, and materials to imbue power into an item.

### Crafting Commitment

- Total SD committed = item’s final **capacity**
- **1 SD = 1 day** of crafting
- Multiple crafters can share commitment
- If one person completes it alone, they are **fully attuned** at creation

---

### Materials & Magic

- Materials are chosen by the **GM**, based on item type and rarity
- **Above Common**: requires a magical **conduit** to be imbued
- Magic (rituals, workshops) may **accelerate crafting time**

---

### Item Customization

- Items can be imbued with Cantrips/Spells/Techniques
- Items (including weapons/armor) have 9 attribute slots 
- Must choose all **attributes** at crafting time
- Each cantrip, spell, or technique uses a number of attribute slots equal to its Source Cost (minimum 1)

| Limit | Attribute Types |
|-------|------------------|
| 9     | Cantrips, Spells, Techniques |

---

### Item Activation

- Activating the cantrip, spell, or technique requires a Core Action or equivalent and an expenditure of Source or Movement equal to the Attribute.

- If attuned with an item, you add your proficiency to checks made with the item, including Activation.

- Items are activated using your choice of either Wisdom, Knowledge, or Influence.

> Note: Common items do **not** require attunement.

---

## Mythic Items

Divine constructs, vastly powerful, change how Source scales.

### Mythic Item Traits

- **Source Pool**: 20d20 or more committed during crafting.
- **Effect**: Increases your **base SD by your level**
- You may spend SD **up to your character level per turn** (instead of up to proficiency)
  - Exceeding the proficiency cap within a round still causes **strain**

### Limits & Requirements

- Only **one Mythic item** may be attuned at a time
- Requires **10+** in **Wisdom, Knowledge, or Influence**

---

### Mythic Loadout Example

- Level 17 character with a Mythic item
- Base SD = 20 → becomes **37**
- Attuned item SD pool can total **up to 37**
- If attuned to three Legendary items = 36 SD:
  - Total usable SD = **37 (char) + 36 (items) = 73**

# Core Rules: Ability Checks, Proficiency, and Targeting

## Ability Checks

To make an ability check:
- Roll a d20
- Add the relevant **ability modifier**
- If proficient, add your **proficiency bonus**

You succeed if the total equals or exceeds the **Difficulty Check (DC)**.

### Base DC for Untargeted Tasks

> **DC = 30 – Your Ability Score**  
> (e.g., Climbing with Agility 13 → DC 17)

**30** represents the “fabric of reality”—ability scores reflect your leverage against it.

### Modifier Table

| Ability Score | Modifier |
|---------------|----------|
| 6             | –2       |
| 8             | –1       |
| 10            | 0        |
| 12            | +1       |
| 14            | +2       |
| 16            | +3       |
| 18            | +4       |
| 20            | +5       |

- Every 2 points **above 10**: +1 modifier  
- Every 2 points **below 10**: –1 modifier

---

## Proficiency

- All characters start at **+2 proficiency**
- Increases over time based on level:

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1     | +2                |
| 3     | +3                |
| 5     | +4                |
| 7    | +5                |
| 9    | +6                |
| 11   | +7                 |
| 13   | +8                |
| 15   | +9                |
| 17    | 3rd Proficient Ability |

---

## Proficiency Cap

- The **Proficiency Cap (PC)** is the **Source limit** you can spend on a technique (attack, spell, etc.)
- The Proficiency Cap is equal to your Proficiency Bonus
- This cap **cannot** be exceeded. **After** activating a Core Action or Reaction, you cannot spend Movement or Source Dice exceeding your proficiency as part of that action.
  
    e.g. Your proficiency is +2. You spend 20ft of movement to take a Core Action: Attack and commit 2 Source Dice to increase the damage of the attack. The Proficiency Cap is not exceeded.

- **Crafting** is exempt from this cap.

---

## Targeting

To target a creature:
- Roll d20 + your **modifier**
- Add **proficiency** if proficient
- Compare against the target's **relevant ability score**

### Targeting DC

> **DC = Target’s Ability Score**  
> Success = Your total ≥ Target's score

### Targeting Examples

| Action Type         | Targeted Ability |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Melee/Ranged Attacks| Agility          |
| Force/Restrain Spells | Strength        |
| Poison/Disease      | Constitution     |
| Illusion            | Wisdom           |
| Memory Alteration   | Knowledge        |
| Charm/Compulsion    | Influence        |

- Note: Spell attacks that deal damage on "hit" target Agility.

---

## Contests

Two creatures directly oppose each other in an action (like gaining control of an item):

- Both roll d20 + modifier (+ proficiency if applicable)
- SD may be spent **before the roll** to increase the result of the check: +1 per SD
- Highest result wins
- **Ties** = stalemate

> **Social contests**:
> - Source Dice should **not** be required to initiate the check unless the outcome changes the scene significantly.
> - If the GM does call for SD, it should **not cost more than 2 SD** to initiate the check.

### When Social Checks **Should Cost SD**

- Alters NPC behavior
- Bypasses real danger
- Replaces combat (e.g., forcing surrender)

### When They **Should Not Cost SD**

- Flavor, banter
- No major consequence
- Normal conversation

---

## Interparty Contests

- PvP combat is allowed
- **Do not** use social checks to override another PC’s actions
- Coercive or forced outcomes between PCs should be avoided

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage:

  - When you have advantage on a check, roll two d20 and take the higher result.

  - When you have disadvantage, roll two d20 and take the lower result.

---

## Disciplines

- On character creation, choose **2 disciplines**
- When **proficiency increases**, you:
  - Choose one new discipline
  - May reassign one previous choice
- In **Ascended Play (Level 21+)**, you may reassign **one discipline every odd level**

---

### Example Disciplines

**Strength**  
- Brute force (T/U)

**Agility**  
- Athletics (U), Piloting (U), Sleight of Hand (T/U), Stealth (T)

**Constitution**  
- Concentration (U), Endurance (U)

**Knowledge**  
- Arcana (U), History (U), Lore (U), Medicine (T/U), Perception (T/U), Tech (T/U)

**Wisdom**  
- Insight (T), Investigation (U), Mechanics (T/U), Nature (U), Streetwise (U), Warfare (U)

**Influence**  
- Coercion (T), Deception (T), Leadership (T), Negotiation (T), Performance (T)

---

### Targeted vs. Untargeted Disciplines

- **T (Targeted):** Only works against another creature (e.g., Persuasion)
- **U (Untargeted):** Interacts with world/knowledge (e.g., History)
- **T/U:** May be either (e.g., Brute force)

> Edge Case: If targeting a creature’s score makes no narrative sense, GM may call it untargeted.

    - Example: Your character has 17 Knowledge and an Untargeted check to apply a bandage to a teammate (DC: 30-17=13) makes more sense than targeting your comrade's 18 in Constitution. 

This appropriately considers player investment in their ability scores, and better reflects the idea that someone proficient in Medicine will know how to apply a bandage.

Alternatively, making a Medicine check to poison someone's food according to their biometrics would correctly target Constitution (even if the target isn't currently present at the time of poisoning)

---

### Untargeted vs. Uncontested

- **Untargeted:** Interacts with the environment or world
- **Uncontested:** Targets a creature, but they're willing or unaware

#### Examples
- Healing a friendly creature: **DC = 30 – your ability score**
- Friendly negotiation with helpful NPC: No check needed if they’re already willing

---

## Passive Abilities

If you're **proficient** in a discipline:
- Your **ability score = passive score** for that discipline
- No check is needed for **unstressed, untargeted, uncontested** tasks **if DC < passive score**

> If **not proficient**, roll unless the GM says it's trivial.

---

### Passive Examples

| Discipline  | Passive | Task                    | Check?                      |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Perception (proficient) | 16      | Spotting a hidden foe       | Only if foe’s Stealth > 16 |
| Stealth (proficient)    | 17      | Sneaking past guard         | Only if guard’s Perception ≥ 17 |

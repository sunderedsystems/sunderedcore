# How to Play Sundered

**Sundered is a system of agency, risk, and creativity. Every decision matters, and every resource is in your hands. Here’s how to jump in and play:**

---

## Core Philosophy

- **One Pool, Infinite Options:** Everything you do—spells, attacks, counters, extra moves—uses the same pool: Source Dice (SD).
- **Trade & Convert:** Actions, Source, Movement, and even Hit Points can be traded. Turn movement into attacks or convert HP into Source when you need it.
- **Everything is a Choice:** Push harder for bigger rewards, but with real risk (stress and strain).
- **No Arbitrary Limits:** Sundered is about player-driven strategy, not restrictive mechanics.

## Character Basics

**1. Create Your Character:**
- Assign ability scores: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Knowledge, Wisdom, Influence (start at 8, distribute 27 points, max score 20).
- Pick 2 abilities to be proficient in.
- Choose an Echelon (optional, but unlocks unique powers).
- Choose a Class for your core feature and two proficiencies.
- Pick Disciplines tied to abilities.

**2. Know Your Pools:**
- **Source Pool**: Fuels everything. Starts at 6d6; increases at higher levels.
- **Hit Points**: Based on your Source pool (ex: 8d8 = 64 HP).
- **Proficiency**: Sets how many SD you can spend per round (Proficiency Cap).

## The Action Loop

**1. Each Turn:**
- 1 free Core Action (attack, cast, move, special, etc.)
- Spend Source or movement for extra actions.
- Take risks for higher rewards, but going past your proficiency cap means stress and strain penalties.

**2. Every Check:**
- Roll d20 + ability modifier (+ proficiency if proficient).
- To hit/cast, beat the target's relevant ability score (no AC; you’re always rolling vs. an ability).
- Commit SD before rolling; win or lose, you spend what you commit.

**3. Resource Conversion:**
- Convert HP into Source (sacrifice HP = gain SD, up to Con modifier per round).
- Trade movement or Source for actions or extra effects.

---

## Targeting & Damage

- **Targeting:** Melee and ranged attacks target Agility. Spells may target Strength, Constitution, Wisdom, Knowledge, or Influence as described.
- **Damage:** Success means base damage = ability mod + proficiency (+ any SD committed and rolled).
- **Scaling:** After base cost, spend extra SD (up to proficiency) for more damage, effects, or scaling.

---

## Counters & Reactions

- **Block:** Spend SD and roll Strength vs. attack to absorb damage.
- **Parry:** Spend SD and use Agility vs. attack for melee.
- **Counterspell:** Spend SD to counter incoming spells or effects.

---

## Magic & Techniques

- **Spellcasting:** Anyone can learn spells, but you only add proficiency if you’re proficient in the spellcasting ability (Wisdom, Knowledge, Influence).
- **Scaling Spells:** Spend extra SD or movement for greater effects.
- **Concentration:** Hold more than one concentration spell with penalties to stats and movement.

## Allies & Summons

- **Familiars/Pets/Summons:** All require resource management. Each acts on your commands, consuming your actions or Source. Familiars inherit your echelon, pets are tougher but less versatile, summons tie up your SD as long as they last.

---

## Advancing

- **Level Up:** Gain more SD, higher proficiency, new techniques, and class features.
- **Ascended Play (lvl 20+):** Become mythic, gain new resilience to stress/strain, and break new boundaries.

**Play boldly. Trade, spend, convert, and shape every encounter with the resources you control.**

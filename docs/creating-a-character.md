# Core Rules: Creating a Character

## The Echelon System

Choose an Echelon, which affects your party dynamics and grants a powerful unique benefit. Your Echelon helps craft your character’s development and acts as a force multiplier to your techniques.

**What it is:** Your approach to play. You pick **1 Echelon at character creation**. It modifies limits or grants bonuses.

**What it does NOT change:** Your Source totals or Ability Scores.

**When it matters:** Key moments in play where your Echelon affects the story’s outcome.

**Changing Echelons:** This can be story driven, with consideration for how your character has grown. 


### Aegic
**Unique Ability:** Adds proficiency to blocked damage (if proficient in Strength, add proficiency a second time).  
*Role Example:* An Aegis Paladin may specialize in shielding allies and absorbing incoming attacks.

### Aurelic
**Unique Ability:** Can concentrate on 2 spells before incurring the multiple concentration penalty.  
*Role Example:* An Aurelic Sorcerer might specialize in enhancing allies' combat prowess and defenses.

### Ingenic
**Unique Ability:** Adds proficiency when crafting, repairing, or interacting with magical or technological items (non-attack/defense rolls), including computers (if proficient in the affected roll, add proficiency a second time).   
*Role Example:* An Ingenic Rogue might specialize in deploying devices and managing tools mid-combat, or hacking into magical mainframes.

### Malefic
**Unique Ability:** Adds proficiency twice when dealing damage (if proficient when calculating damage, add proficiency to damage a second time).   
*Role Example:* A Malefic Cleric might channel destructive divine energy to wipe out enemies.

### Myric
**Unique Ability:** May spend 2 Source Dice to treat an unstressed, non-combat check as a stressed check in order to gain proficiency, even if they are not normally proficient in the relevant discipline.  
*Role Example:* A Myric Warlock might pick a lock or tame a horse, even if they’d never seen either.

### Vitalic
**Unique Ability:** Adds proficiency twice to healing (if proficient when calculating healing, add proficiency to healing a second time).   
*Role Example:* A Reparative Druid might focus on restoring allies quickly during combat.

## Ability Scores

Characters have 6 Ability Scores. These scores snapshot every creature's core characteristics and affect the three main rolls of the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and counters.

- **Strength** provides passive damage absorption and can be used for melee/ranged attacks.
- **Agility** provides passive dodge and can be used for melee/ranged attacks and parry.
- **Constitution** is used for concentration and endurance checks. It also affects your available Movement and modifies your Hit Points after level 17.
- **Wisdom, Knowledge, and Influence** are used for spellcasting and social checks. 

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

All characters begin with **8 in every ability score**.

At creation, players get **27 points** to distribute among the six abilities.  
- No score may exceed **20** at level 1.  
- **Raising a score above 15 costs 2 points per increment.**

### Point Costs
- 8 → 15 = 1 point per increase  
- 16+ = 2 points per increase  

### Modifiers
- Every 2 points **below 10**: –1 modifier  
- Every 2 points **above 10**: +1 modifier  

---

### Example Stat Block

| Stat        | Score | Modifier |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Agility     | 15    | +2       |
| Constitution| 14    | +2       |
| Strength    | 13    | +1       |
| Wisdom      | 12    | +1       |
| Knowledge   | 11    | +0       |
| Influence   | 10    | +0       |

---

## Ability Score Increase

- **Every even-numbered level** (including 20), gain **+1 ability point**.
- Scores may exceed 20 **after** level 1, but:
  - Every 2 points above 20 must be offset by lowering another score by 1.

> Example: If Knowledge is 21 and Influence is 13, raising Knowledge to 22 means lowering Influence to 12 (or any other stat by 1).

---

## Source Dice (SD)

All characters have a **Source Pool** of dice used to fuel abilities, attacks, and more.

### Source Pool by Level

| Level | Source Pool |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 6d6         |
| 5     | 8d8         |
| 9     | 10d10       |
| 13    | 12d12       |
| 17    | 20d20       |

---

## Replenishment

**Out of Combat:** Automatically regain Source Dice equal to your proficiency every unstressed hour

---

## Hit Points

- **Before level 17**:  
  `HP = Source Dice Size × Number of Source Dice`  
  _Example: 6d6 → 6 × 6 = 36 HP_

- **Level 17+**:  
  `HP = 20 × Constitution score` (not modifier)

---

## Renewal

Regain HP during downtime:

- Regain HP = **Proficiency Bonus + Constitution Modifier** per unstressed hour.  
> Example: +3 Proficiency, –1 Constitution → regain 2 HP/hour

---

## Conversions

| Conversion             | Rule                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 20ft Movement → 1 Core Action   | Spend 20ft for 1 CA      |
| 2 SD → Core Action   | Spend 2 Source Dice for 1 CA     |
| 1 SD → 10ft Movement | Source can be spent for extra Movement |
| 1 Core Action + Movement → Source   | Turn unused Movement into Source or a Technique |

- **When you spend a Core Action + Movement, the Movement is converted into *Source*.**

---

## Core Actions (CA)

- Core Actions include attacks, spellcasting, and d20-based checks.
- Some actions cost **1 CA + additional SD**.
- To take a Core Action:
  -  20ft movement = 1 CA
  -  2 SD = 1 CA
  -  10ft + 1 SD = 1CA

---

## Turns

On your turn:
- You may spend **all your Source**
- You may use **all your movement**.
- Your turn ends when you've used all resources or you choose to pass.

> **Note:** It is important to manage your Source over the course of an encounter, as expending it all on one turn can leave one vulnerable.

---

## Hold Action

You may **hold** an Action or Reaction by specifying a **clear trigger** (e.g. "If a creature enters my range").

-You may hold an action *and* take your turn normally.
- You **do not** pre-commit Source Dice for held actions.
- When triggered, resolve the action immediately, committing necessary resources.
- If resolving it would exceed your SD proficiency cap, it becomes a **Strained** check.
- If you do not have the resources when the trigger occurs, the Action is not triggered.
- If the trigger **never occurs**, you **lose nothing**.

---

## Stress

### Stress

- **All tasks in combat** are considered **stressed**.
- For every **missing SD**, add **+1 DC** to stressed actions.
- **Stressed DC** = +1 per missing SD **at the moment of the check**.

| Missing SD | DC Increase |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | +1          |
| 2          | +2          |
| 3          | +3          |
| ...        | ...         |

> **Ascended Play (Level 21+)**: Stress is reduced to +1 DC per **2 missing SD** (see *Ascended Resilience*).

# Welcome to Sundered Systems

Sundered isn't about limits—it's about possibilities.

This game system is designed around a single, unified philosophy: Agency. At every moment, you're empowered to push boundaries, make meaningful choices, and shape your narrative without arbitrary restrictions.

Here’s how we make that happen:

### 🌀 One Resource, Infinite Possibilities
We use one unified resource — Source — for everything you do. Spells, attacks, extra actions, defensive moves — everything is fueled by the same simple pool. This lets you spend less time tracking different currencies and more time making impactful decisions.

### 🔄 Trade & Convert Freely
Actions, Source, Movement, and even Hit Points aren't isolated mechanics; they're interchangeable currencies. Need an extra strike at a critical moment? Spend some Movement or convert HP into Source.

### 🧭 Movement Matters
Movement isn’t just about positioning; it's a tactical resource. Every step counts. You can turn your unused movement into extra attacks, defensive actions, or spell enhancements.

### ⚔️ Risk & Reward
Everything powerful comes at a cost. You can always reach beyond your normal limits, but it gets riskier the further you stretch. Pushing harder initiates Strain, making your actions more difficult — and all the more rewarding.

In short, Sundered places the power firmly in your hands. Your decisions carry weight. Your strategies shape every encounter. And when you take risks, you'll feel the stakes.

Play bold. Play creatively. This is your story. Let’s see how far you can push it!

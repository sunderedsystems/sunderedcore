# Welcome to Sundered Systems

Sundered isn't about limits—it's about possibilities.

This game system is designed around a single, unified philosophy: Agency. At every moment, you're empowered to push boundaries, make meaningful choices, and shape your narrative without arbitrary restrictions.

Here’s how we make that happen:

### 🌀 One Resource, Infinite Possibilities
We use one unified resource — Source — for everything you do. Spells, attacks, extra actions, defensive moves — everything is fueled by the same simple pool. This lets you spend less time tracking disparate mechanics and more time making impactful decisions.

### 🔄 Trade & Convert Freely
Source and Movement aren't isolated mechanics; they're interchangeable currencies. Need an extra strike at a critical moment? Convert unused Movement into Source and attack!

### 🧭 Movement Matters
Now Movement isn’t just about positioning; it's a tactical resource. Every step counts because you can turn your unused movement into extra attacks, defensive actions, or spell enhancements.

### ⚔️ Risk & Reward
Everything powerful comes at a cost. Tense situtions including Combat incur Stress, making simple tasks harder depending on how much Source you've spent; and if you overextend and fully deplete Source, your Movement is halved.

In short, Sundered places the power firmly in your hands. Your decisions carry weight. Your strategies shape every encounter. And when you take risks, you'll feel the stakes.

Play bold. Play creatively. This is your story. Let’s see how far you can push it!

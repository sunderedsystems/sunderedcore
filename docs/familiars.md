# Familiars

A familiar is a magical (or mundane) companion bound to you through the Source.
Familiars are more than pets—they are semi-autonomous extensions of your will, spirit, and power.
Any character may attune to a familiar, commanding it in and out of battle. Familiars can aid in combat, scouting, spellcasting, and serve as loyal mounts or messengers, depending on their nature and abilities.

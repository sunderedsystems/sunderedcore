# Core Rules: Movement & Combat

## Movement

### Base Movement

- Characters between 4ft and 6ft tall: **50ft per round**
- For every **+1 Agility modifier**: +10ft
- For every **–1 Agility modifier**: –10ft

---

### Size Modifiers

- All player characters count as **Humanoid size**
- Creatures under 4ft: **40ft base movement**
- Creatures over 6ft:
  - Gain **+10ft per 12 inches** over 6ft
  - Lose **1 Agility** due to bulk
- Creatures larger than Humanoid are targeted by **Constitution**, not Agility, for attacks requiring a "hit" to apply damage.

---

### Terrain & Conditions

- **Difficult terrain**: Halves movement
- **Stealth or climbing**: Halves movement
- **Stealth + climbing**: Movement reduced to **¼**
- **Encumbrance**: If carrying more than `Strength × 10 lbs`, lose **10ft per 10 lbs over**

---

### Flanking

- If two or more allies are directly flanking an enemy (i.e., positioned on opposite sides), you gain a +2 bonus to attack checks against that enemy.
- This bonus applies to all attacks made while flanking.
- Flanking does not grant advantage.

---

## Interaction & Combat Movement

- **5ft**: Interact with an item (draw weapon, drink potion)
- **10ft**: Disengage without provoking reactions or counters

---

### Source Strain

- If **Source is empty** (including attuned items): Movement is **halved** due to fatigue

---

## Attacks

- **Melee**: Use **Strength** or **Agility**
- **Ranged**: Use **Agility**

### You may spend one of the following to attack:

- 1 **Core Action**
- 2 **Source Dice**
- 20ft **Movement**
- 10ft Movement + 1 **SD**

---

## Weapon Requirements

If you don't meet the weapon's minimum score:
- Add the **difference** to the attack’s DC

### Weapon Requirement Table

| Weapon Type     | Min Strength | Min Agility |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1H Melee/Shield | +1           | +1          |
| 2H Weapon       | +2           | +1          |
| Ranged          | +1           | +2          |

---

## Damage

For a successful **melee, ranged, or cantrip** hit using a Core Action or movement:

> **Base Damage = Ability Modifier + Proficiency (if applicable)**

---

## Damage Pool

When you spend SD for a **damage action** (e.g., using 2 SD instead of Core Action):

- Add SD to the **damage pool**
- **Commit SD before** rolling the d20

> If you **miss**: SD are lost  
> If you **hit**: Roll the pool and apply damage

> SD spent to **scale effects** (not damage) do **not** go into the damage pool

---

## Source Scaling

After paying the base attack cost, you may spend **extra SD** to:

- **Increase damage**
- **Enhance effects**
- **Increase #targets**

> SD spent must be **declared before the roll**  
> Miss = SD is still **lost**

---

## Committed Dice

You must **commit** SD before rolling to attack or counter:

- Declare how much Source (or Movement) you spend
- On success: resolve as normal
- On failure: SD are **lost**

---

## Melee Movement Scaling

**Press the Attack**  
If you hit with a melee attack, you may spend unused movement:  
> +1 damage per **10ft** spent

**Dig In**  
You may spend unspent movement to reduce physical damage:  
> –1 damage per **10ft** spent

> Spells that affect movement may boost these 

---

## Last Gasp Initiative

- When you are reduced to **0 HP**, you immediately gain the next turn in the round (your “Last Gasp”).
- Your **movement speed is reduced to zero**. However, you may spend **1 SD for every 10ft of movement** you wish to use during this turn.
- During your Last Gasp, you may spend **Source Dice equal to your level**.
    - If you **exceed your proficiency cap**, you take **strain** as normal.
- If your **Source** reaches zero at any point during your Last Gasp, your turn ends and you die.
- **Alternatively**, you may use your Last Gasp Initiative to **describe your death** or **speak your final words**.

---

## Death, Recovery, & Resurrection

**Death is just a door.** If the party is able and willing, fallen comrades can be returned to life by various powers or quests.

- **Recovery** is determined by the method used to restore a character to life—whether through specific powers, spells, or the outcome of a narrative quest.
- The precise effects and consequences of resurrection are set by the rules of the spell, ability, or GM discretion.

> *The story may dictate unique consequences, costs, or requirements for returning from death, at the GM’s option.*

## Encounters

Encounters include **combat**, **negotiation**, or other tense scenes.

---

## Encounters & Initiative

When combat or a turn based encounter begins, roll for Initiative:

- Roll **d20 + Wisdom modifier**
- Add proficiency **if proficient in Wisdom**
- Highest result goes first

> Turns proceed in descending order

---

## Rounds

Combat proceeds in **rounds**:

- Each creature **acts or passes**
- A Round ends when all have taken a turn (including counters)
- Turn: May spend SD up to proficiency; use your movement; pass when resources exhausted or by choice

---

## Surprise

If ambushing or acting unnoticed:

- Ambushers **Agility (Stealth)** vs targets’ **passive Knowledge (Perception)**
- On success: Gain a **free round** before initiative order begins

> For groups, GM may determine success as **per creature** or **threshold-based**

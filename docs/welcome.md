# Welcome to Sundered Systems

**Sundered isn't about limits—it's about possibilities.**

This game system is designed around a single, unified philosophy: **Agency**. At every moment, you're empowered to push boundaries, make meaningful choices, and shape your narrative without arbitrary restrictions.

Here’s how we make that happen:

---

### 🌀 One Resource, Infinite Possibilities  
We use one unified resource — **Source** — for everything you do. Spells, attacks, extra actions, defensive moves — everything is fueled by the same simple pool. This lets you spend less time tracking different currencies and more time making impactful decisions.

---

### 🔄 Trade & Convert Freely  
Actions, Source, Movement, and even Hit Points aren't isolated mechanics; they're **interchangeable currencies**. Need an extra strike at a critical moment? Spend some Movement or convert HP into Source.

---

### 🧭 Movement Matters  
Movement isn’t just about positioning; it's a **tactical resource**. Every step counts. You can turn your unused movement into extra attacks, defensive actions, or spell enhancements.

---

### ⚔️ Risk & Reward  
Everything powerful comes at a cost. You can always reach beyond your normal limits, but it gets riskier the further you stretch. Pushing harder initiates **Strain**, making your actions more difficult — and all the more rewarding.

---

In short, **Sundered places the power firmly in your hands.** Your decisions carry weight. Your strategies shape every encounter. And when you take risks, you'll feel the stakes.

**Play bold. Play creatively. This is your story. Let’s see how far you can push it!**

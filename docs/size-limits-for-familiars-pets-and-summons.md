# Size Limits (Familiars, Pets, Summons)

The **maximum size** of a creature you can control is based on your **proficiency bonus**:

| Proficiency | Max Size      | Examples                  |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| +2          | Tinyâ€“Medium   | Rat, cat, humanoid        |
| +3 to +5     | Large         | Horse, bear, dire wolf    |
| +6 to +8     | Huge          | Giant toad, ogre, dragon  |
| +9         | Gargantuan    | Ancient dragon            |


You may control multiple small creatures, but never a single creature above your size limit. Your summons are not required to be a specific size (+9 can be humanoid size). GM may adjust borderline cases by theme.

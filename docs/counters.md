# Counters and Reactions

A **counter** is an action taken in response to a successful attack or effect—whether targeting yourself or an ally.

At the time of incoming spells or damage, targets must choose if they will counter, and how.

Counters are resolved first by type, then initiative order.

A counterspell resolves first, then block, then parry, then non-action. 

If multiple people choose to counterspell, the first in initiative order makes the first check. 

>Example: The party is targeted by a successful damaging area of effect spell.
- One player chooses to counterspell. Another Chooses to block with their magic shield. The third chooses to accept the hit.
- The counterspell fails. 
- The blocker commits SD, then rolls to reduce the incoming damage.
- The third takes damage normally.

## Absorption

- Base physical absorption = **Strength modifier**
- If proficient in Strength: add **proficiency bonus**
- Absorption is **passive**

> Note: Common weapons, armor, and shields **cannot absorb magical damage**  
> Only **magical** equipment may absorb **magical** damage

---

## Block

You may **block** incoming physical damage by:

- Spending **1+ SD** (up to proficiency), or  
- Spending **10ft or more of unspent movement**

### Block Steps

1. Roll committed SD  
2. Add:
   - Strength modifier
   - Proficiency (if proficient)
   - Any Dig In bonus
3. Subtract that total from the incoming damage

> **Magic damage** may only be blocked using **magical weapons or shields**

### Dig In (Block or Parry)

Spend **10ft movement = –1 damage** reduction

> Example:  
Incoming damage = 17  
You commit 3 SD (roll 10), Str mod +3, Prof +3, and Dig In (20ft = –2)  
Total absorbed = 10 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 18 → **no damage taken**

---

## Parry

You may **Parry** melee attacks **if wielding a melee weapon**.

- Spend **1+ SD** (up to proficiency), or  
- Spend unspent movement (10ft per –1 damage)

### Parry Steps

1. Roll committed SD  
2. Add:
   - Agility modifier
   - Proficiency (if proficient)
   - Dig In bonus (if applied)

> **You cannot parry** ranged or magical attacks

> Example:  
Incoming damage = 17  
You commit 3 SD (roll 10), Agi mod +3, **not proficient**, and Dig In (20ft = –2)  
Total absorbed = 10 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 15 → **2 damage taken**

---

## Counterspell

You may **counter successful spells** by committing SD.

### Countering Spell Damage

- Spend **SD equal to spell level**
- Roll a counter check against **opponent’s successful check total**
- Success = damage is prevented

### Countering Status Effects

- Spend **SD equal to spell level**
- Roll a counter check against the caster's total
- Success = status effect is canceled

> If SD spent exceeds your proficiency cap, it becomes a **strained check**

---

## Critical Counters

- A **natural 20** on a counter check results in **critical mitigation**
- Fully cancels **both effects and damage**
- Works for countering spell damage or effects

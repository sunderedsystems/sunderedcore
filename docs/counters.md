# Counters and Reactions

A **counter** is an action taken in response to a successful attack or effect—whether targeting yourself or an ally.

---

## Absorption

- Base physical absorption = **Strength modifier**
- If proficient in Strength: add **proficiency bonus**
- Absorption is **passive**

> Note: Common weapons, armor, and shields **cannot absorb magical damage**  
> Only **magical** equipment may absorb **magical** damage

---

## Block

You may **block** incoming physical damage by:

- Spending **2+ SD** (up to proficiency), or  
- Spending **20ft of unspent movement**

### Block Steps

1. Roll committed SD  
2. Add:
   - Strength modifier
   - Proficiency (if proficient)
   - Any Dig In bonus
3. Subtract that total from the incoming damage

> **Magic damage** may only be blocked using **magical weapons or shields**

### Dig In (during Block)

Spend **10ft movement = –1 damage** reduction

> Example:  
Incoming damage = 17  
You commit 3 SD (roll 10), Str mod +3, Prof +3, and Dig In (20ft = –2)  
Total absorbed = 10 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 18 → **no damage taken**

---

## Parry

You may **Parry** melee attacks **if wielding a melee weapon**.

- Spend **1+ SD** (up to proficiency), or  
- Spend unspent movement (10ft per –1 damage)

### Parry Steps

1. Roll committed SD  
2. Add:
   - Agility modifier
   - Proficiency (if proficient)
   - Dig In bonus (if applied)

> **You cannot parry** ranged or magical attacks

> Example:  
Incoming damage = 17  
You commit 3 SD (roll 10), Agi mod +3, **not proficient**, and Dig In (20ft = –2)  
Total absorbed = 10 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 15 → **2 damage taken**

---

## Counterspell

You may **counter successful spells** by committing SD.

### Countering Spell Damage

- Spend **SD equal to spell level**
- Roll a counter check against **opponent’s successful check total**
- Success = damage is prevented

### Countering Status Effects

- Spend **SD equal to spell level**
- Roll a counter check against the caster's total
- Success = status effect is canceled

> If SD spent exceeds your proficiency cap, it becomes a **strained check**

---

## Critical Counters

- A **natural 20** on a counter check results in **critical mitigation**
- Fully cancels **both effects and damage**
- Works for countering spell damage or effects

---

## Reactions

### Counteraction

Used against untargeted threats (traps, falling objects, magical bursts).

Spend one of:
- 20ft of movement
- 10ft movement + 1 SD

Then roll a **stressed check** determined by GM  
> +1 DC per missing SD

---

### Counter Attack

When a creature within 5ft **tries to leave** your melee range:

- Make a **melee attack** as a reaction

#### Cost (choose one):

- 1 SD  
- 10ft unspent movement

> Counts toward proficiency cap  
> Cannot counter attack the **same creature more than once per round** unless specified by an ability

---

## Dodge (Passive Defense)

- **Passive Dodge = Agility score**
- If proficient in Agility: add **proficiency bonus**

### Targeting Dodge

- Any **physical or spell attack** requiring line of sight must beat Passive Dodge

> Passive Dodge = **DC** of the targeting check

---

## Ending Status Effects

To end an escapable effect (e.g., Grappled, Restrained, Charmed):

Spend one of:
- 2 SD  
- 20ft movement  
- 1 SD + 10ft movement

Then:
- Roll 1d20 + appropriate ability modifier (+ proficiency if applicable)
- Beat the DC or contested roll of the source

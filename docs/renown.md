# Renown

Renown measures your party’s reputation, notoriety, or heroic status in a particular region. It’s a localized advantage, regenerating daily while the party remains present and active.

## Establishing Renown

When entering a community where your deeds matter (heroic, infamous, or disruptive), the GM assigns a Renown pool.

- Renown is used only for **social** encounters in that region.
- When spent, it grants proficiency to social checks (If not proficient, add proficiency. If proficient, add twice)
- Renown is specific to each region and regenerates daily while present.

### Status and Typical Tokens

| Status          | Tokens | Example Deeds                        |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Local Hero      | 1–3    | Minor recognition (e.g., saving a villager) |
| Regional Champion | 4–6    | Major accomplishments (e.g., saving a town) |
| Legendary       | 7–10+  | Reshaping a region (e.g., slaying a dragon) |

## Spending Renown

Players can spend Renown tokens on social checks, but only when interacting with individuals or systems influenced by their reputation in that area. This includes:

- Social leverage (advantage on social checks)
- Favors or exemptions (free lodging, waiving fees, permission to bear arms, reduced spell or item costs)
- Commanding attention (gain an audience, inspire a crowd, sway a mob)
- Access to restricted services (private guild contracts, closed-door auctions, military aid)

Renown cannot be spent in combat—its power lies in narrative, social, and political leverage.

## Regeneration and Decay

- **Regeneration:** The pool refreshes each dawn while the party remains in the region.

**Decay:**
- If the party leaves, Renown fades at a pace set by the GM (–1 token per week/month/year).
- Deeds may become exaggerated, forgotten, or even challenged.

To maintain or grow Renown, players must return and continue engaging with the community—helping, disrupting, or otherwise making themselves known.

### Tarnished Renown

- If infamous, Renown still applies, but:
  - Helpful actions may cost more tokens.
  - NPCs may act out of fear, suspicion, or duress.
  - In strict regions, Renown may work as Notoriety and attract negative attention.

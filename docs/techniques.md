# Core Rules: Magic and Techniques

## Techniques

Characters develop signature techniques tied to their **ability scores**. These include spells, actions, criticals, or personalized combat styles (attacks).

### Technique Proficiency

- These are specializations you’ve **mastered** and perform efficiently.
- However, you **only** add proficiency to known techniques **if proficient** in the related ability score.

### Technique Capacity

For each ability:
- You may know a number of techniques equal to your **modifier**.

If proficient in the ability:
- You may know **Modifier + Proficiency** techniques.

> Example:  
> Strength 16 (+3), not proficient → 3 techniques  
> Wisdom 17 (+3), Proficiency +3 → 6 techniques

### Technique Reassignment

- Reassign techniques when **proficiency increases**  
- Or every **5 levels beyond level 20**

---

## Critical Techniques

Expand tactical options and count against total known techniques.

### 1. Acquisition

- All critical techniques count toward your known technique limit.

### 2. Application

**Banking Crit Damage**  
- When you land a melee or spell hit, you may bank **crit damage = proficiency** (before damage applies)

> Example: At level 1, you can bank +2 damage on a hit

**Spending from the Critical Damage Bank (CDB)**  
- Spend crit damage after successfully applying damage (post-defenses)
- Only apply a **known** critical techniques
- Techniques are chosen from the **Critical Effects Table**

### 3. Defense

**Critical Mitigation**  
- If you Block or Parry a hit with a crit effect, spend from your **own crit bank** to cancel it
- You must match the **full cost**
- **Cannot** mitigate a natural 20

> See also: *Natural Crit*, *Critical Table*, *Melee/Spell Criticals*

---

## Sunder

A special critical technique available to all (does not need to be known).

- Higher-tier items can sunder lower-tier ones
- **Mythic** items cannot be sundered

> Knowing Sunder lowers damage thresholds by 1

### Sunder Effects

| Damage Spent | Effect        | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 10           | Damaged       | –2 to checks/rolls using item |
| 15           | Dysfunctional | –6 to checks/rolls using item |
| 20           | Destroyed     | Item is broken (ritual may be required for magical items) |

---

## Spellcasting

Anyone can cast spells using **Influence**, **Knowledge**, or **Wisdom**.

- Add **proficiency** only if you’re proficient in that spellcasting ability

---

### Spell Difficulty

- Spells add their level to the DC
- Cantrips are level 0

>Example: When you cast a 3rd level spell, the DC is increased by +3

---

### Casting Requirements

- Requires **verbal/somatic components** unless using a spell focus
- Costs:
  - **1 Core Action**
  - SD = spell level (or equivalent cost like movement)
- Exceeding proficiency cap by level = **strained** spell

> Casting a 3rd-level spell at Proficiency +2 = +1 DC for Strain.
> The total increase to the DC is +4 (+3 for 3rd level spell and +1 for Strain)

- Only **spells of a level (1-9)** count toward the proficiency cap
- **Spells do not level up** (a level 1 spell is always level 1) —they scale via SD


---

### Base Spell Damage

> **Spell Damage = Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency (if proficient) + SD spent to cast**

**Examples**:  
- Cantrip: Modifier + Proficiency  
- 3rd Level Spell: +4 (Mod) +2 (Prof) +3SD (roll damage)

---

## Scaling Spells

You may spend **extra SD** to:

- Increase **damage** (damage pool)
- Increase **area/range**
- Add **targets** (1 per SD)

> SD used to scale = increased counter cost

> Exceeding your cap = **strained check** (+1 DC per missing SD)

> Cantrips may scale as well

---

## Spell Movement Scaling

### Arcane Advantage

Sacrifice **10ft of movement** to gain:

- +1 damage  
- +10ft area/range
- +1 target  


> Movement must be committed **before casting**  
> Also increases counterspell cost by +1 SD per 10ft

---

## Spell Costs

Spells may cost:
- Core Action
- Source Dice
- Movement
- Or a mix

> Base movement (50ft + 10ft × Agility Mod) can be converted  
> **Bonus movement** cannot be converted

---

## Spell Resolution

- **Commit SD** before rolling
- **On fail**: all SD lost
- **On success**:

> **Total Damage = SD Roll + Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency**

---

## Spell Targeting

Targeting follows all normal rules:

- Check is made against the **target's relevant ability score**
- If multiple targets: use **highest relevant score**
- If not targeting a creature (e.g., objects, location): DC = 30 – your spellcasting score

---

## Concentration Spells

- Duration = until concentration is broken
- You may concentrate on **multiple** spells, but with penalties:

| # of Spells | Penalty               |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 2+          | –20ft movement/round per extra spell

> Movement cannot be negative
> If a spell would do so: it **fails**

> Ending extra spells removes the penalties  
> Movement returns at start of next turn

---

## Concentration & Damage

If hit while concentrating:

1. Drop the spell(s), **or**  
2. Make a **stressed Constitution check**:

> DC = (30 + 1 per expended SD) – Constitution score

Fail = all concentration ends  
Success = continue uninterrupted

---

## Learning Spells

All spells gained **after** character creation must be learned. You do **not** have to learn the spells your character starts with.

### Learning Requirements

1. Pass check:  
> DC = 30 – Spellcasting Score + Spell Level

2. Spend 1 Core Action + SD equal to the spell level

> Example:  
> Wisdom 17, learning level 2 spell → DC 15, 1CA, 2SD

### Failed Attempts

- Subsequent attempts become **stressed**
- You may retry **unstressed** after full **Source recovery**
- Once you know a spell, it is permanently known.

>Note: Spells do **not level**—use scaling rules

---

## Channeled Abilities

Unlike spells, these draw from **discipline** or **inner force**.

- No verbal/somatic components
- No spellcasting check required

### Channeled Ability Rules

- **Not spells**
- **No concentration** required
- **No casting penalties** (e.g., can use while raging)
- Pay **SD on activation**

> Most have persistent effects for rounds or until cancelled

---

## Empowerment (Buff Spells)

- All empowerment spells require **concentration**

### Scaling & Costs

- +1 to ability = **+1 SD**
- Requires **Proficiency ≥ bonus granted**
- Lasts until concentration is broken

> Example:  
> +6 Strength → 6 SD, must have Proficiency +6  
> Difficulty Check (DC) = new total score (e.g., Strength 18 = DC 18)

---

## Technique Crafting

Create custom spells, moves, or actions using SD system.

### Designing a Technique

- **Name** – Creative title
- **Trigger** – Core Action, reaction, combo?
- **Ability** – What activates it
- **Target & Type** – Who it affects, what ability it targets
- **Effect** – Damage, condition, etc.
- **Cost** – CA or CA + SD

> SD cost based on power, condition, and scaling

---

### Examples

**Fight Dirty**  
> Throw sand into an opponent’s eyes  
> Blind for 1 round  
> Agility vs Agility  
> 1CA, 2SD, or 20ft / 10ft + 1SD  
> Scaling: +1 SD per extra target

**Lock Pick**  
> Gain lockpicking as a technique  
> Agility-based  
> DC = 30 – Agility  
> 1CA, 2SD, or 20ft / 10ft + 1SD  
> No scaling
